ToDo List ReactJS
==================

Installation
------------

We use `yarn` instead of `npm` to lock dependencies versions. 

So the first step is to [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

To download dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Available commands:

```bash
yarn start      # Compile develop build and watch files for changes
yarn build      # Complie production build
yarn eslint     # Lint JS files
```
